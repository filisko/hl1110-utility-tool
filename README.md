# Brother HL-1110 printer utility tool

This tool will mainly allow you to do the following in your Brother HL-1110 (or HL-1112) printer.

    - Informational messages.
    - Operator Intervention Conditions messages.
    - Hardware related error messages.
- Get the current amount of printed pages.
- Print basic information about printer's status and settings.
